    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Warming chicken, mushroom & leek pie is sure to be a crowd-pleaser. You
      are sure to enjoy the succulent chicken and crisp puff pastry.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 large chicken breasts</li>
      <li>4 skinless boneless chicken thighs</li>
      <li>2 bay leaves</li>
      <li>½ small pack thyme</li>
      <li>½ small pack flat-leaf parsley, leaves and stalks separated</li>
      <li>2 large onions, chopped</li>
      <li>1 garlic clove</li>
      <li>1 chicken stock cube, crumbled</li>
      <li>750ml milk, plus extra to glaze</li>
      <li>100g butter</li>
      <li>3 leeks, chopped</li>
      <li>300g button mushrooms, halved</li>
      <li>100g plain flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
      <li>200ml crème fraîche</li>
      <li>500g puff pastry</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Put the chicken in a large pan with the bay, half the thyme sprigs, the
        parsley stalks, onions, garlic, stock and seasoning. Pour the milk over
        the chicken and, if you need to, top up with water to make sure the
        chicken is covered. Bring the chicken to the boil, then turn down and
        simmer for 15 mins. Lift from the liquid and leave to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain the poaching liquid through a sieve into a large jug – you need
        650ml to make the sauce for your pie.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat the butter in a saucepan over a low-medium heat. Add the
        leeks and the mushrooms, and cook for 5-10 mins until soft, then season
        well. Add the flour and stir to coat the vegetables. Slowly add the
        poaching liquid, stirring until you have a thick sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using two forks, pull the chicken apart into thumb-sized chunks rather
        than chopping it – I feel you get a far better pie this way. Chop the
        parsley leaves, then stir into the leeks with the thyme leaves, crème
        frâiche and chicken. Check the seasoning, then spoon the mixture into
        your pie dish (or dishes) to cool slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Roll out the pastry on a lightly
        dusted work surface to the thickness of a £1 coin. Cut thin strips from
        the edges and use a little water to stick these around the lip of the
        pie dish, then wet the top of the pastry strip. Lift the pastry on top
        of the pie, trim the edges and crimp them with your fingers or a fork.
        Brush the top with milk and cut a steam hole in the middle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the dish on a baking sheet and cook in the oven for 20-25 mins until
        the pastry is risen and golden. Some of the filling will have bubbled up
        through the steam hole.
      </li>

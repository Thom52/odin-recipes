    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Still a relatively cheap cut, pork belly yields beautiful soft flesh and
      crisp crackling when slow-roasted.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tbsp fennel seeds</li>
      <li>1 tsp black peppercorns</li>
      <li>1 small bunch thyme, leaves only</li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>1.5-2kg/3lb 5oz-4lb 8oz piece boneless pork belly, skin scored</li>
      <li>2 lemons</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Toast 2 tbsp fennel seeds and 1 tsp black peppercorns in a dry frying
        pan for a couple of mins. Pound them together in a pestle and mortar
        with some flaked sea salt, the leaves from 1 small bunch of thyme and 3
        garlic cloves to make a paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix with 2 tbsp olive oil and rub all over the flesh of a 1Â½ - 2kg piece
        of boneless pork belly. Cover and chill, leaving to marinate for a few
        hours or overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        When ready to cook, rub the skin of the joint with plenty of salt and 1
        tbsp more olive oil. Sit on a wire rack in a roasting tin and roast at
        200C/180C fan/gas 6 for 30 mins.
      </li>
      <li>
        After this time, squeeze 2 lemons over the skin and turn the heat down
        to 180C/ 160C fan/gas 4. Roast for a further 2 hrs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, turn the heat back up to 220C/ 200C fan/gas 7 and give it a
        final blast for another 30 mins or so, to finish the crackling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow to rest somewhere warm for 20 mins. Carve up into chunks or slices
        and serve with the braised cabbage (below) and bay-infused potatoes (see
        'goes well with').
      </li>

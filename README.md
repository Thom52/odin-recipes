# odin-recipes

First Odin-Project assignment. Make a recipe webpage using the basic HTML knowledge gained during their foundations course.

I will be creating a main index.html which will have headings, paragraphs and links redirecting to different recipes. Each recipe will also have an image of the food the recipe is about.

We shall return to this project and add in CSS once I have completed their CSS foundations course.
